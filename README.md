# Some of my python experiments.
Above are some of my python experiments.  I am not a programmer; I create these little programs as experiments to play with the language. I find python very interesting language for any beginner to learn and it is so much vast that it is fun to explore its various applicableness.

Facebook Analysis : I analyzed my posts from facebook using Facebook Graph API. I exported the posts using the API into a pickle format file and then using matplotlib module made a histogram showing the time of all my posts.
